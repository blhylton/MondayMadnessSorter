# Monday Madness

Just a simple script for helping build brackets for the http://amateuresports.gg/ Monday Madness tournaments. Was literally written in an hour, so it's a bit sloppy.

## Usage

```
mondaymadness <input_file.csv> [pretty_output_file.txt] [importable_output_file.txt]
```

For instance

```
mondaymadness input.csv pretty.txt import.txt
```

Output files are optional. If no output files are specified, the default files are 'pretty-output.txt' and 'importable-output.txt' and will be placed relative to the executable.
